# Simple Fit – Simple, tailored workouts at your fingertips.
Find the perfect workouts for your body and your lifestyle. Start living healthier today!

## Motivation
With Simple Fit, you can browse a wide range of workouts tailored to your specific needs. Whether you're looking to tone up, build muscle, or improve your overall fitness, we've got you covered.

And if you don't see a workout that meets your needs, you can easily create your own by aggregating exercises from our extensive library.

But it doesn't stop there. Simple Fit also makes it easy to plan out your week by allowing you to combine workouts into collections. This way, you can easily decide which workouts to do each day, ensuring that you stay on track and make progress towards your fitness goals.

So why wait? Start living a healthier lifestyle today with Simple Fit.

**Note:** This project is not completed. I worked extensively on it during the holiday season in 2022 as GPT-3 and AI was really becoming all of the buzz. I had a vision to create and curate workouts generated by AI. The currently implementation does not include an AI implementation, but rather references workouts from [muscleandstrength.com](https://www.muscleandstrength.com/exercises). This project is no longer my priority, and may or may not be developed on further.

## Contributing
